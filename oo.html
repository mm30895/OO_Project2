                <h2>Colors</h2>
                <p>Color theory is a fundamental concept in design, affecting how viewers<br>
                    perceive and interpret visual information. Understanding color psychology<br>
                    can help designers evoke specific emotions and create engaging<br>experiences for users.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: right;">Gestalt</h2>
                <p style="text-align: right;">The Gestalt principles explain how humans perceive and make sense<br>
                    of visual information. By understanding these principles, designers can<br>
                    create more effective layouts and designs that enhance user <br>experience and communication.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Analogus</h3>
                <p>Analogous colors, as a core principle of color theory, are hues that sit next to each other on the color wheel, sharing similar undertones. Their proximity creates a harmonious palette that is visually pleasing and cohesive in design.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Closure</h3>
                <p>Closure is a principle that refers to the mind's tendency to perceive incomplete objects as complete or whole. When presented with a complex arrangement of elements, our brains seek to organize them into recognizable patterns or forms, even if some parts are missing or ambiguous.</p>

                <p>Triadic color schemes consist of three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel. When used effectively, triadic color harmonies can create vibrant and dynamic designs that capture attention and communicate messages effectively.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Complementary</h3>
                <p>Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When used together, complementary colors create strong visual contrast and can make designs more vibrant and dynamic.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Similarity</h3>
                <p>The principle of similarity in Gestalt psychology suggests that the human mind tends to group together objects or elements that share common attributes such as shape, size, color, or texture. This grouping helps simplify visual perception by organizing complex scenes into cohesive patterns or clusters.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Hue</h3>
                <p>Hue refers to the pure spectrum colors found on the color wheel, such as red, blue, or yellow. It is the attribute that distinguishes one color from another based on its dominant wavelength of light. In simpler terms, it's what we typically think of as "color".</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Continuation</h3>
                <p>Continuation suggests that when elements are arranged in a line or curve, people tend to perceive them as belonging together and forming a continuous path, even if parts of the line are obscured or interrupted. This principle highlights our tendency to perceive patterns and relationships in visual stimuli, filling in gaps and completing shapes to create a coherent perception of the whole.</p>

                <h2>Saturation & Common Ground</h2>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Saturation</h3>
                <p>Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color. A highly saturated color appears vivid and vibrant, while a desaturated color appears more muted or washed out. Adjusting saturation can significantly impact the visual impact of a color, allowing designers to create different moods or effects within their compositions.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Common Ground</h3>
                <p>Common ground refers to the shared knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions between communicators that enable effective communication. It's the foundation upon which meaningful interaction is built, allowing people to understand each other's perspectives and convey information efficiently. This shared understanding facilitates smoother communication and fosters mutual comprehension and cooperation.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Light</h3>
                <p>In the context of color, "light" typically refers to the brightness or luminance of a color. Lightness determines how light or dark a color appears, with lighter colors having higher levels of brightness and darker colors having lower levels. Adjusting the lightness of a color can alter its perceived value and contribute to the overall contrast and mood of a design.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Figure-Ground</h3>
                <p>The figure-ground principle in Gestalt psychology refers to the perception of objects or elements in a visual scene as either the main figure or the background against which the figure stands out. The figure is the object of focus, while the ground is the background against which the figure is perceived. This principle illustrates how our minds distinguish between foreground and background in visual stimuli, allowing us to perceive and interpret objects in our environment.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Temperature</h3>
                <p>In color theory, "temperature" refers to the perceived warmth or coolness of a color. Warm colors, such as reds, oranges, and yellows, are associated with heat and sunlight, while cool colors, like blues and greens, evoke a sense of calmness and coldness. Temperature can influence the emotional impact of a design and is often used to convey specific feelings or atmospheres.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Common Fate</h3>
                <p>The common fate principle in Gestalt psychology suggests that elements that move together or change in a similar way are perceived as belonging together or forming a unified group. This principle highlights our tendency to perceive objects that share a common direction or motion as part of the same cohesive entity, helping us make sense of dynamic visual scenes and organize them into meaningful patterns.</p>

                <p>Adjusting the combination of hue and saturation impacts the overall vibrancy, emotional tone, and visual hierarchy of a design, influencing its mood and coherence.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Symmetry & Order</h3>
                <p>Symmetry and order, as Gestalt principles, describe how the human mind naturally organizes visual stimuli into balanced and structured arrangements, promoting aesthetic appeal and facilitating easier perception and comprehension of the elements presented.</p>

                <p>
                    Manipulating temperature and lightness in combination influences the warmth or coolness of colors and their brightness, which can evoke specific emotions, set the mood, and create depth in a design.</p>
