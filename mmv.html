                <h3>The Software Behind Greg's Creation</h3>
                <p>Blender is the 3D modeling software we studied in our MMV course. We started by<br>
                    familiarizing ourselves with Blender's interface and basic tools. Gradually, we<br>
                    progressed to more advanced techniques, learning how to model, texture, and<br>
                    animate a character from scratch. Here is a roadmap of our journey, highlighting<br>
                    the key steps we took to create and bring Greg to life using Blender.</p>

                <h2>Basic Modeling in Blender</h2>
                <p>We explored the basics of the modeling tool Blender. We got to know<br>
                    the interface, the organization of tools, and the workflow in the tool. We undertook<br>
                    the creation of a basic 3-dimensional model using fundamental modeling approaches.</p>

                <h2>Modeling and Rigging</h2>
                <p>We learned how to model using a reference image. We worked on creating<br>
                    a low-poly model and refined it as much as possible to prepare it for animation.<br>
                    Next, we revised and prepared the model from what we previously did, ensuring it was <br>
                    suitable for animation by adding a skeleton or armature and completing the rigging process.</p>

                <h2>Animation</h2>
                <p>We learned the basics of animation using our existing model. We started by understanding
                    keyframe animation and how to set up a timeline in Blender. We practiced creating simple
                    animations, such as walking and idle, to bring our low-poly model to life. Next, we
                    refined our animations to make them smoother and more realistic.</p>
